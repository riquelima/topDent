// I will check DentistDashboardPage.tsx for the definition of VerticalAgendaCard
// to see if it needs changes. Looking at the existing code, it is defined
// inside DentistDashboardPage.tsx. The change needed is to remove `md:max-h-96`
// from the content div.

// The component is defined inside `DentistDashboardPage.tsx`. I will apply the changes there.
// Specifically, I am removing `md:max-h-96` from the content `div` to allow the cards to grow.

// The change will be reflected in the updated `pages/DentistDashboardPage.tsx`.
